# EANx-Calculator
A program written in Python that can calculate [1] Maximum Operating Depth (MOD), [2] Optimal EANx mixture, and [3] Oxygen dose.

This program offers a simple command-line interface to navigate the various calculations imperative to diving with EANx (Enriched Air Nitrox - breathing gas with > 21% Oxygen content).

1. Calculate the Maximum Operating Depth (MOD) for a given EANx blend, respecting the 1.4 PO2 (Partial Pressure of Oxygen) Oxygen dose limit.
2. Calculate the optimal gas mixture for a given maximum depth, respecting the recreational maximum oxygen content of 40%.
3. Calculate the Oxygen dose (PO2 of the given breathing gas at the given maximum depth), respecting the 1.4 PO2 Oxygen dose limit.

## You may be thinking ...

***Is it not true that the vast majority of dive computers are capable of performing these calculations ?***

> While true, I conceived of this project during my EANx certification course to practice coding and study this life-saving information simultaneously.

***Are there not apps available that perform these calculations ?***

> Yes, in fact, there are. My favorite is a free app aptly named `Nitrox Buddy` which I discovered during the development of this program. To reiterate, this was a side project used to practice my Python programming skills and intrench valuable knowledge for EANx SCUBA diving.
